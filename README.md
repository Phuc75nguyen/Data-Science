This repository is including:

1. Data file at csv (sf_Library.csv)
2. 7_SFLibrary_Project.ipynb in which we used Python to:

  Step1. Cleaning this data sf_library

  Step 2. Exploration data by drawing some kinda plot (using matplotlib libraries)
  
  Step 3. After Exploring this data, and understanding the correlation between these rows. We applied Machine Learning to predict the patron type.
    1. Naive Bayes Model
    
    2. Random Forest
    
    3. Decision Tree Model
    
  Then, we used the Accuracy, and F1-score to measure the quality of these algorithm's model.
  

3. Step 4 is the Presentation: including the result of cleaning data, plots and graphs, ML's result and conclusion.
